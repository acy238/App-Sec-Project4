We can see that when a card is used (by looking at the file: UseCard.kt) that a "token" is generated from the "loggedInUser" at line #37.
  line #37 -> var token : String = "Token " + loggedInUser?.token.toString()
  This token is subsequently passed into a function call as the second parameter at line #48.
  However, the validity of this token is NOT checked.
  
Starting at line #48, client.useCard(card?.id, token)?.enqueue(object : Callback<Card?> {...}, we see that the token is the second parameter.
The first parameter is: "@Path("card_number") card_number: Int?"
  And we see that the card number is the identifier given to the "Path" for the function: "useCard" defined within "CardInterface.kt".
  Hence, the application will use a giftcard with that specific giftcard number in its path, and an unverified token.
  
The problem occurs when an adversary purchases a giftcard for a few dollars/cents (near free), and attempts to decrement the giftcard's "card_number".
  The adversary could decrement the "card_number" by a single unit, until a giftcard (that is not used yet) is found by the adversary.

A potential solution would be to check that the giftcard's owner matches the user of the given token.
