Question 1. What are the two types of Intents?
Answer: Implicit and Explicit Intents.

Question 2. Which of the two types of Intents are more secure?
Answer: Explicit Intents, however it is not always practical/realistic in modern times.

Question 3. What type of Intent is shown on lines 69 to 73 of SecondFragment.kt?
Answer: Lines 69-73 in SecondFragment.kt show an implicit intent, because it does not specify which Android components to be called - just the action to perform.

Question 4. What type of Intent is shown on lines 68 to 70 of ThirdFragment.kt?
Answer: Lines 68-70 of ThirdFragment.kt show an explicit intent, because the call included the specific activity class in the parameter:
  "ProductScrollingActivity::class.java"

Question 5. Which of these two Intents is the proper way to do an Intent?
Answer: The explicit intent from ThirdFragment.kt is the proper way to do an Intent.

Lastly, explain which intent needed to be fixed and why.
Answer: We changed the implicit intent in SecondFragment.kt to an explicit intent with this code below: 
  Yes -> var intent = Intent(activity, ProductScrollingActivity::class.java)
  No? -> var intent = Intent(activity, CardScrollingActivity::class.java)
  The code above includes the specific activity class when called for the intent type to browse giftcards.

Within AndroidManifest.xml, we made the following changes to permissions.
First, we created/defined our own app's custom permissions with the <permission> tag within <manifest>. 
Next, we included the name of our custom permission with the <uses-permission> tag within <manifest> for our app.
Lastly, we restrict other app's interactions with our app's intents by including the "android:permission" attribute to the <activity> tag.
  This attribute is added to the (5) following activities in the manifest:
    1. UseCard
    2. GetCard
    3. ProductScrollingActivity
    4. CardScrollingActivity
    5. MainActivity
